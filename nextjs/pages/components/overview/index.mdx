# Introduction
Wingsuit is a toolset to build CMS independent TWIG components with Storybook and integrate these components with [apps](/apps/overview/) into your CMS.
You describe all aspects of your component in a YAML file which is used by Storybook to display all of these aspects.
Wingsuit [presets](/presets/overview/) adds additional tools like webp, favicon generation without custom webpack configuration.

With a component based architecture for TWIG you have a single point of truth for every of your template. This makes it much easier to maintain your codebase.

The Wingsuit kickstarter helps you to integrate your component without any additional mapping code.
