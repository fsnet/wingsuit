# What's new in Version 1.1
We have added a lot of new features in Version 1.1. Additionally, we rebuild our docs page.
We build a Static Site Generator for Wingsuit. This makes it easy to build static pages like this doc page with Wingsuit components.

## Nesting inside your wingsuit.yml
Now you can build complexe render trees inside your `wingsuit.yml`
The following example renders a form.
```yml
fields:
  children:
    type: pattern
    label: Children
    multi_value_type: single_value
    preview:
      id: form-checkboxes
      fields:
        children:
          - id: form-element
            variant: "checkbox"
            fields:
              description_content: ""
              errors: ""
            settings:
              type: checkbox
          - id: form-element
            variant: "checkbox"
            fields:
              description_content: ""
              errors: ""
            settings:
              type: checkbox
```

## Awesome Drupal Kickstarter
We rebuild the Drupal Kickstarter. We removed Acquia Lightning and build a Layout Builder interface which makes fun to work with.
For that we build the [Gin Layout Builder](https://www.drupal.org/project/gin_lb) and the Wingsuit Layout Builder Module as part of the [Wingsuit companion module](https://www.drupal.org/project/wingsuit_companion) which integrates [Section Library](https://www.drupal.org/project/section_library) and [Layout Builder Browser](https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_builder_browser).
Also, we add a lot of new features to [UI Patterns Settings](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_settings).

Check out the [Drupal Kickstarter page](/drupal/ui_patterns)
