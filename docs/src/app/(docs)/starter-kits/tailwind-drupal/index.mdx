# Drupal loves TailwindCSS

The Tailwind starter kit the quickest way to get up and running with Wingsuit.

TailwindCSS and Drupal is great team if you structure your templates component based.
One TWIG template must be the single point of truth otherwise TailwindCSS is not maintainable.

Drupal out of the box provides templates for each form / element /etc. We need a mechanisms to map
these templates to components. In Drupal there are two possibilities. Presenter templates or the UI Patterns
ecosystems. UI Patterns is a no code solution to map entities to Patterns.

The starter kit is using UI Patterns.

To use the tailwind starter kit standalone install it with:
```
npx @wingsuit-designsystem/cli init -k tailwind
```

To use the starter kit checkout the [Drupal kickstarter page](https://wingsuit-designsystem.github.io/drupal/ui_patterns/)
