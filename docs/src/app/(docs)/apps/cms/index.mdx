# CMS APP

Wingsuit also ships with a generic CMS APP.

To install the app run:
```bash
yarn ws generate-app
```

Wingsuit adds a config entry to your Wingsuit YAML. Check out the [configuration page](/configurations/details) for more details.

Run either `yarn ws dev cms` for dev mode or for build mode `yarn ws build cms`.

After starting the app Wingsuit generates a dist folder with all assets and templates.

## Template path
For some CMS it is not possible to load TWIG templates from a different location. With `assetAtomicFolder: '../templates'` you can point your templates to folder outside the dist folder.
The path is relative to the dist folder. The CMS preset will rename the folder structure to the configured namespace structure.
