# Drupal APP

Wingsuit also ships with a drupal APP.

To install the app run:
```bash
yarn ws generate-app
```


Wingsuit adds a config entry to your Wingsuit YAML. Check out the [configuration page](/configurations/details) for more details.

## Run app
Run either `yarn ws dev drupal` for dev mode or for build mode `yarn ws build drupal`.

After starting the app Wingsuit generates a dist folder with all assets and templates.

## Integrate into Drupal

With the [components](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module you can map namespace to the TWIG templates inside your dist folder.
